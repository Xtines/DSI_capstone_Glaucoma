# Data Science Institute Masters in Data Science, Capstone project - Glaucoma Prediction with Deep Learning

1.1. Project Scope and Goals

This Capstone project is a collaboration between Columbia University’s Data Science Institute and Johnson & Johnson.

The optic cup to optic disc ratio (CDR) is an important measurement in glaucoma diagnosis. In this project the objective was to obtain the CDR, not to make a glaucoma diagnosis.
Cup-to-disc ​ratio is defined as the ratio of vertical distances between pixels at the highest and lowest vertical position inside the cup and disc region. Evaluation of the CDR is done upon examination of the retina or a retinal (fundus) photo.

CDR measurements are highly subjective and inconsistent even among experts. Current methods are mostly qualitative, resulting in poor reproducibility. While AI models have been developed, none have been deployed on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for practical use in a clinical setting.

The goal of this project was to leverage GCP and its AI tools to build a deployable artificial intelligence based system to estimate cup to disc ratios for unannotated color fundus images.
